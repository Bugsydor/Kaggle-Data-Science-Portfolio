# Kaggle-Data-Science-Portfolio
This repo is meant to showcase the data science skills I'm honing with self-directed projects and/or competitions on Kaggle.

It's currently all in Python, but I am planning to add work in R as well to round it out.

## ToC
* **cleaning-water-data.ipynb:** Cleaning three years of water data and combining it into a single dataframe.
* **mtg-color-guesser.ipynb:** An end-to-end data science project where I create an ML model to read Magic card data and guess what color the card is.
